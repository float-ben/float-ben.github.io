I specialize in software, but I'm also experienced in developing autonomy sensing, intermediate PCB Design, and hardware design (CAD). When I’m not on the job, I love doing sports, working my way through every episode of the new show I'm watching, and indulging in my love for outdoor activities. If you’d like to contact me, please reach out via email (benliangcs@gmail.com).",
